Copy and paste this entire prompt into Claude Code CLI:

I need to set up and deploy the FURG app on my iPhone tonight. I have the complete codebase already built in `/home/user/cuponer`. Please help me:

## 1. Backend Setup & Dependencies

**Install and configure everything for the backend:**
- Install all Python dependencies from `backend/requirements.txt`
- Set up PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose
- Create and configure the `.env` file with my API keys (I'll provide them when asked)
- Initialize the database with the schema from `database/schema.sql`
- Start the backend server and verify it's running
- Test all API endpoints to ensure they work

**I'll provide when you ask:**
- My Anthropic API key
- My Plaid credentials (Client ID and Secret)
- Any other required API keys

**Verify:**
- Backend runs on `http://localhost:8000`
- `/health` endpoint returns healthy status
- Database is initialized and accessible
- All environment variables are set correctly

## 2. Get My Mac's Network IP

**Find and document:**
- My Mac's local network IP address (for iPhone to connect)
- Update the iOS app's `Config.swift` with this IP automatically
- Verify the IP is reachable from the network

## 3. iOS App Preparation

**Prepare the iOS app for Xcode:**
- Verify all 17 Swift files are present in correct locations
- Update `App/Config.swift` with my Mac's IP address
- Create a clear file checklist showing what goes where
- Generate exact instructions for what I need to do in Xcode

**Create a step-by-step Xcode guide that tells me:**
- Exactly what to click in Xcode (with screenshots descriptions)
- What settings to configure
- How to add the files
- How to enable Sign in with Apple
- How to configure code signing

## 4. Testing & Verification

**Set up testing:**
- Create a test script to verify backend is accessible from network
- Test all API endpoints work correctly
- Provide curl commands I can run to verify everything
- Create a troubleshooting checklist

## 5. Xcode Setup Instructions

**PAUSE HERE FOR MY INPUT**

**Generate a detailed guide for me to:**
1. Create the Xcode project (exact steps)
2. Add all Swift files in correct structure
3. Configure app signing with my Apple ID
4. Enable required capabilities (Sign in with Apple)
5. Update any Xcode-specific settings
6. Build and run on my iPhone

**I will do the Xcode parts manually while you:**
- Watch for errors I report
- Help troubleshoot any build issues
- Guide me through code signing problems
- Verify the app connects to the backend correctly

## 6. First Launch Testing

**After I get the app running, help me:**
- Test Sign in with Apple authentication
- Verify backend connectivity
- Test each feature (chat, balance, transactions)
- Troubleshoot any connection or API issues
- Confirm all features work end-to-end

## 7. Final Verification Checklist

**Create a comprehensive checklist showing:**
- ✅ Backend is running and accessible
- ✅ Database is initialized with schema
- ✅ iOS app is built in Xcode
- ✅ App is installed on my iPhone
- ✅ Sign in with Apple works
- ✅ Chat functionality works
- ✅ All API endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ Ready for daily use

## How I Want You to Proceed

**Phase 1: Automated Backend Setup (You do this)**
- Install dependencies
- Configure environment
- Start services
- Verify everything works
- THEN pause and show me status

**Phase 2: Xcode Setup (I do this with your guidance)**
- You generate detailed instructions
- I follow them in Xcode
- I report back any errors
- You help me troubleshoot
- We iterate until it builds

**Phase 3: iPhone Installation (I do this with your guidance)**
- I build and run in Xcode
- I install on my iPhone
- I test basic functionality
- You help me verify everything works

**Phase 4: End-to-End Testing (We do together)**
- I test each feature
- You monitor backend logs
- We troubleshoot together
- We verify complete functionality

## Important Notes

- **Stop and ask me** when you need:
  - API keys or credentials
  - Me to do something in Xcode
  - Me to test something on my iPhone
  - Confirmation before changing important settings

- **Show me exactly** what you're doing:
  - Display all commands before running them
  - Explain why each step is needed
  - Show me the output/results
  - Wait for my confirmation on critical steps

- **For Xcode parts** (which you can't do):
  - Generate crystal-clear instructions with exact button names
  - Show me what the UI should look like (descriptions)
  - Give me the exact text to type
  - Provide screenshots descriptions or mockups if possible

- **Troubleshooting**:
  - If something fails, stop and explain the error
  - Give me options for how to fix it
  - Don't retry automatically without asking

## My Context

- I'm on macOS (the repo is at `/home/user/cuponer`)
- I have Xcode installed (or will install it)
- I have an iPhone I can connect via USB
- I have an Apple ID for code signing
- I'm on the same WiFi network with my iPhone
- I want this working TONIGHT

## Expected Timeline

- Backend setup: 10-15 minutes
- Xcode project creation: 10 minutes (with your guidance)
- First build and install: 5-10 minutes
- Testing and troubleshooting: 10-15 minutes
- **Total: 35-50 minutes**

## Start Here

Begin with Phase 1 (Automated Backend Setup). Ask me for any API keys you need, then set up and start the backend. Once that's verified working, we'll move to Phase 2 (Xcode).

Let's get FURG on my phone tonight! 🚀
